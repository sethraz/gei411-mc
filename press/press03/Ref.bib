@article{Berry2008,
Abstract = {When Spatial Analysis was published in 1968, it drew together the fruits of the first decade of geography's quantitative revolution. In the decades that have followed, quantitative geography has both diffused and concentrated, abandoned some themes, made major progress on others, and in the contemporary form of geospatial analysis has become an innovative multidisciplinary enterprise. In this article, we sketch the broad outlines of this history, lay out the main threads along which technical capabilities have developed, and describe what appear to us to be the leading questions at the research frontier. Even as many geographers disavow social science, geospatial science has emerged as a lusty arena marked by intellectual vigor, conceptual growth, and enhanced analytic abilities. What now is taking shape is a spatially integrated social–environmental science that is transcending older disciplinary attachments, boundaries, and constraints. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

@article{Haining2010,
Abstract = {Geostatistics is a distinctive methodology within the field of spatial statistics. In the past, it has been linked to particular problems (e.g., spatial interpolation by kriging) and types of spatial data (attributes defined on continuous space). It has been used more by physical than human geographers because of the nature of their types of data. The approach taken by geostatisticians has several features that distinguish it from the methods typically used by human geographers for analyzing spatial variation associated with regional data, and we discuss these. Geostatisticians attach much importance to estimating and modeling the variogram to explore and analyze spatial variation because of the insight it provides. This article identifies the benefits of geostatistics, reviews its uses, and examines some of the recent developments that make it valuable for the analysis of data on areal supports across a wide range of problems.

Due to the encouraging strong interest in the German edition Springer Verlag offered to publish an English translation. First of all I would like to thank Ralf Gerstner from Springer for this and for his helpful suggestions for improvement, as well as Annika Brun for translating most of the text, Colin Marsh for copy editing, and Katja Diederichs for converting all scripts from German to English. Last year I benefited a lot from a communication with Antony Unwin. His book “Graphical Data Analysis with R” can be seen as complementary tomy own:while this one focusses on presentation of graphics, you will benefit from his book if you are interested in exploring data graphically.
